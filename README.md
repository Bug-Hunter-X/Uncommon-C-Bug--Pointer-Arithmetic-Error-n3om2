This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates an uncommon error involving pointer arithmetic. The program calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. However, it contains a subtle bug that can cause unexpected behavior or even crashes. The bug lies in the improper use of pointer arithmetic, which can lead to accessing memory outside the allocated bounds. The solution demonstrates a corrected approach to perform pointer arithmetic safely.
